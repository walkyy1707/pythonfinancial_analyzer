Key Fixes and Improvements
1. Authentication Fix
Issue: Previous TypeError due to incorrect login() arguments.

Fix: Updated authenticator.login() to use form_name and location keywords, ensuring compatibility with streamlit-authenticator.

2. Secure Credential Management
Improvement: Moved hardcoded credentials to a config.yaml file.

Note: Ensure config.yaml is added to .gitignore to prevent exposure in version control.

3. Real-Time Updates
Issue: Infinite while True loops were incompatible with Streamlitâ€™s single-threaded model.

Fix: Replaced with a controlled, periodic update using st.empty() and a limited iteration loop for demonstration purposes.

4. Multiple Data Sources
Improvement: Added support for Finnhub (stocks) and CCXT (crypto) with a user-selectable dropdown, enhancing versatility.

5. Enhanced Portfolio Management
Improvement: Replaced text area input with a structured form for adding portfolio entries, stored in SQLite (scalable to PostgreSQL for larger datasets).

6. Advanced Price Predictions
Improvement: Added ARIMA and Prophet models, selectable via a dropdown, with customizable forecast periods.

7. UI Enhancements
Improvement: Moved settings and login to the sidebar for a cleaner layout, added tooltips (via descriptive labels), and used columns for real-time and historical data display.

8. Performance and Robustness
Improvement: Added @st.cache_data for data fetching to improve performance, and included error handling to gracefully handle data retrieval failures.
